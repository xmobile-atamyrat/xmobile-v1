# XMobile React Native App

This is the React Native mobile app for XMobile ecommerce platform. The app wraps the web application in a WebView, providing a native mobile experience while leveraging the existing web UI.

## Overview

- **Platform**: Android (iOS support to be added in Phase 2)
- **Web App URL**: `http://192.168.1.231:3003`
- **Package Name**: `com.xmobile.app`
- **Display Name**: XMobile

## Architecture

The app uses:
- `react-native-webview` to render the web application
- `react-native-safe-area-context` to handle device safe areas (notches, status bars, navigation bars)

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

#### Development Mode

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android:dev
# OR
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android:dev
# OR
yarn android
```

#### Building APK/AAB

You can build the Android app using gradlew commands:

```sh
# Build debug APK
npm run android:build:debug
# OR
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK
npm run android:build:release
# OR
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease

# Build release AAB (for Google Play Store)
npm run android:build:aab
# OR
cd android && ./gradlew bundleRelease

# Clean build artifacts
npm run android:clean
# OR
cd android && ./gradlew clean
```

**Note**: You can also build manually from Android Studio by opening the `android/` directory as a project.

The built APK will be located at:
- Debug: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- Release: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
- AAB: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
